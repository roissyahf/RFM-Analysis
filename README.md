# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and KMeans Clustering
## Problem Statement
The e-commerce industry is becoming increasingly competitive. In order to improve their services, retain customers, and attract new ones, e-commerce businesses need to modernize their marketing and customer strategies by personalizing them.
There are a variety of data science models that can help with this, and one of them is customer segmentation analysis.

## Project Description
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on their shared characteristics.
This can be done by considering factors such as demographics, interests, purchase behavior, and other factors.
Customer segmentation can help businesses develop more effective marketing and personalization strategies by targeting their messages to the right customers.

One of the simplest methods of customer segmentation is RFM analysis. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. Frequency refers to how often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary value refers to how much money a customer spends.

In this project, I used data from Kaggle to segment Brazilian e-commerce customers. The dataset contains around 110,000 transactions.
This data includes information about the customers, such as purchase history, and product preferences. I utilized RFM analysis and clustering.
I extracted valuable information from these segments and built dashboards with the insights. These insights can be used to improve products and marketing strategies.

## Methodology
1. Define the research questions.
2. Collect the data.
3. Clean the data.
4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
5. Perform Feature Preprocessing to create recency, frequency, and monetary value columns.
6. Create RFM segments using quantiles.
7. Define RFM segments.
8. Group RFM segments.
9. Analyzing RFM segments.
10. Train KMeans models to segment the data.
11. Cluster Interpretation.
12. Build a dashboard with the insights.
