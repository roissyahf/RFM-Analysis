# Starlex E-ommerce Dashboard

This is a very simple static dashboard that I built using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). The main objective is to practice how to create dashboard with streamlit. Enjoy!

## Setup environment
```
conda create --name simple-dashboard python=3.9
conda activate simple-dashboard
pip install pandas plotly seaborn jupyter streamlit
```

## Run streamlit app
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## The dashboard appearence

It has been deployed, [just check this out here](https://starlex-ecommerce-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
